\label{sec:introduction}

\todo{Introduction goes here.}

\todo{We motivate the problem of deciding serializability in programmable networks.}

\todo{We talk about some related work if relevant.}

\todo{We show that it's interesting with an example.}

\todo{We describe our main results.}

\paragraph{Contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Novel notion of serializability (``atomicity'' or ``semantic serializabillity'') applicable to network systems (\Cref{sec:problem-definition,sec:related:notions-of-serializability})
    \item Decidability results (1 main theorem: \textbf{automatically proving unbounded serializability}, 2 extra theorems: ser=ser decidable, ser=int undecidable) (\Cref{sec:formal-results,sec:related:deciding-serializability})
    \item Implementation of decision procedure. Advances in semilinear sets, Petri net reachability heuristics that makes the decision procedure work. (\Cref{sec:implementation,sec:related:petri})
\end{itemize}
