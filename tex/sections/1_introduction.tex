\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\todo{Introduction goes here.}

\todo{We motivate the problem of deciding serializability in programmable networks.}

\todo{We talk about some related work if relevant.}

\todo{We show that it's interesting with an example.}

\todo{We describe our main results.}

\paragraph{Contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Novel notion of serializability (``atomicity'') applicable to network systems
    \item Decidability results (1 main theorem: \textbf{automatically proving unbounded serializability}, 2 extra theorems: ser=ser decidable, ser=int undecidable)
    \item Implementation of decision procedure
    \item Advances in semilinear sets, Petri net reachability heuristics that makes the decision procedure work
\end{itemize}
