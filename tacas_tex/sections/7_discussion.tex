%\subsection{Limitations}

%\noindent
\textbf{Limitations.}
Petri-net reachability is \texttt{Ackermann}-complete~\cite{CzWo22}, so some complex benchmarks time out despite optimizations. Our current backend (\texttt{SMPT}~\cite{AmDa23}) may also miss existing proofs. Finally, the NS model assumes request/response interactions and does not cover streaming, callbacks, or partial responses.

%\subsection{Future Work}
\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Future Work.}
We are developing polyhedral reductions~\cite{AmBeDa21,Be87,BeLeDa20} to verify reduced nets and lift proofs to the original. We also plan to support richer communication models beyond independent clients.

%
%\paragraph{Scalability.}
%
%Our evaluation shows that some benchmarks still time out.
%To improve \textit{scalability}, we are developing both theory and implementation of \textit{polyhedral reductions}~\cite{AmBeDa21} --- that are structural reductions~\cite{Be87,BeLeDa20} of the form $(N_1, m_1) \vartriangleright_E (N_2, m_2)$ where $N_2$ is a simpler Petri Net and $E$ is a formula enabling reconstruction of $N_1$'s state space from $N_2$'s. This would let us verify the reduced net and lift proofs back to the original net.

%\guy{Nicolas are you sure about the next sentence? Do you have an explanation or a "negative proof"?}
%
%Furthermore, we note that polyhedral reductions are the only type of structural reduction for which such a conversion is possible.
%
%We are developing both theory and implementation for this extension.

%\todo{Limitations?}
%Examples we cannot solve, future work that would help

%
%In another axis, we aim to \textit{extend our framework to more diverse communication patterns.}
%\paragraph{Extensions to diverse communication models.}
%Currently, clients act independently: each issues a request, receives a response, then verification is centralized. Stronger models allow inter-client communication or partial orderings (Lamport’s \textit{happens-before}~\cite{La78}); weaker ones forbid post-response communication or permit only limited summaries. Addressing such settings will require decentralized certification or streaming proofs under communication constraints. Extending our framework along these axes would capture a broader class of practical distributed-system guarantees.


%\paragraph{Extensions to diverse communication models.}
%
%Our current framework assumes that clients act independently --- each submits a request, receives a response, and only afterward collaborates to verify (in a centralized manner) whether the combined outcomes are serializable. However, in a stronger model, clients may communicate during execution or enforce partial ordering of their interactions. More generally, this can be formalized via Lamport’s \textit{happens‐before} relation over request/response pairs~\cite{La78}. 
%%
%In contrast, a weaker model disallows communication --- in which case clients either cannot communicate after receiving responses or may only share limited summaries. Jointly deciding serializability in this setting will require decentralized certification techniques or streaming proofs that respect tight communication constraints. 
%%
%By extending our theory and tool along these two axes, we aim to cover a broad spectrum of practical distributed‐system guarantees, that are more complex and match broader, real-world scenarios.

%
%\todo{Different notions of serializability}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \todo{Current notion: clients independently submit a request and get a response, and later they all get together and see if what they got was serializable}
%    \item \todo{Stronger: clients are not independent, or sequentially execute some parts. General: we have some happens-before on the requests/responses}
%    \item \todo{Weaker: the clients cannot communicate with each other afterwards to determine whether what they got was serializable, or they can only communicate in a limited way}
%    \item \todo{Infinite / unbounded executions}
%\end{itemize}



\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Conclusion.}
We presented the first implemented tool that verifies serializability for unbounded concurrent systems and generates proof certificates, bridging theory and practice with a decision procedure, key optimizations, and an evaluation on diverse, realistic benchmarks.
